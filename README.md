```
./
    public/  -- The Folder holding your website
        index.html  -- The HTML page that is loaded first. The 'homepage'
        css/        -- Holds all our stylesheets
            pizza.css   -- Our homepage's main styles
        js/         -- Holds all our javascript scripts

    database.rules.json -- Firbase configuration files
    firebase.json       --  will be autogenerated

    gulpfile.js     -- Uses a node package to help us build. Feel free to ignore.
    package.json    -- Autogenerated by node to describe our project. Also feel free to ignore.
    README.md       -- This handy instruction file!
    .gitignore      -- If you're using git, this tells it what we don't want in the repo.
```

## Steps
1. Download Code
2. Run the code in the browser, either using `node` and `gulp` or
 just opening the `index.html`  
    --> if you have `node` installed:  
    --> run `npm install` from a command line in the
    **base of this directory**.  
    --> then run `npm install -g gulp`  
    --> then run `gulp dev`  


## Extensions
* [Firebase UI Web](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Web) : More 
    cohesive when working with many auth types


## Based on a Bootstrap template!

[Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Agency](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/)

## Developing Using Source Files

To use the source files, you will need to have node and npm installed globally along with Gulp.js. To start:
* Run `npm install` in the root directory
* Run `gulp dev` and edit the files as needed
